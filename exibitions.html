                    <h2>"Will I disappear?"<br>
                        Nature: Expressed in paintings, photographs and sculpture
                    </h2>
                    <p data-notlast>
                        Pavla Parik presents several paintings from her cycle Israel Landscape and environmental paintings and photographs.<br><br>
                        The cycle Israel Landscape was already presented in two exhibitions in Israel - in En Afek Nature Park gallery in spring 2022, and later in Netanya AACI community center together with Sherry Orbach's nature photographs.<br><br>
                        The cycle contains more than 30 large scale landscape paintings from Israel Nature Parks. 
                        During the work on the these paintings Pavla realized that her fascination with nature is not accidental and that she is constantly returning to this topic in her work with unrelenting urgency.
                        Maybe also because along with love of nature, she also feels a huge responsibility exacerbated by the ever-present manifestations of the climate crises
                        The attentive observer certainly did not miss the fact that in recent decades our land (and so does the whole planet) has become more industrialized, with endless sections of land occupied for industrial or development projects.<br><br>
                        People all over the world have already converted 75 percent of the mainland in some significant way. At least 40 percent of the oceans and sea are adversely affected by human activity.
                        A quarter of all species are threatened with extinction, which is tragic in itself, but it also threatens the vital ecosystem.<br><br>
                        Expanding protected land and sea globally is a key action that will help reverse these trends, protect biodiversity and support human wellbeing.

                        <br><br>In Colaboration with:
                        <br>- Sherry Orbach, Photographer
                        <br>- Barry Korzen, Photographer

                                In Pavla's paintings of this cycle the themes of harsh conditions and germinating life are interwind as a symbol of the fact that life can miraculously develop and survive even in totally inhospitable conditions. She uses symbols such as rocks, desert, cracked dry land or stairs of ancient water reservoirs in contrast to the symbols of life as are the germinating seeds, trees wedge into the rocks or the fragility of our bodies.
                                <br><br> 
                                Sometimes she uses the image of archeological sites in contrast to elements of today world as a depiction of the thin but yet strong bond of humanity and its past and also as a disturbing reminder of tragic history and its cyclicality

                                Paintings from this cycle were created over several years. Some of them realistically depict traditional Jewish objects while some are more abstract and imaginative in which Pavla displays Jewish symbols with deep spiritual meaning.<br><br>

                                Each of the pictures is connected with a feeling or memory.
                                Pavla raises the motifs in her paintings to a personal level indicating stories hidden behind them.
                                Although there are no people depicted in the paintings, we feel their presence and their relationship to spirituality.

                                "In this exhibition Pavla presents several paintings from her series of landscapes from Israel's nature parks that was recently exhibited at the En Afek gallery in En Afek Nature Park.<br><br>

                                Originally, she did not plan to create a series of paintings, but the idea arose spontaneously, in reaction to relaxing days spent with family, while hiking, observing and photographing nature.<br><br>

                                Pavla finds that she continuously returns to the subject of nature and specifically the land of Israel as her focus, as it is quite urgent to preserve the beauty of our country, as it grows with buildings, nature is being reduced and more garbage is being produced and littered."
